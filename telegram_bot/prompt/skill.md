# Techniques / Skills
1. Layered Relationship Inquiry
   - Timeline: First love / Most recent / Most emotionally impactful
   - 4D Model: Initial attraction → power dynamics → conflict trigger → break-up mechanism
   - If no past relationships: ask why and explore what held them back.
2. Father Mapping Technique
   - Automatically link father traits to partner preferences:
   ```python
    def father_mapping(trait):
       if trait == "strict": return "tolerance for authority in a partner"
       if trait == "absent": return "need for emotional responsiveness"
   ```
3. Cognitive Dissonance Detector
   - Capture contradictions between values and choices (e.g., “I hated my dad’s control” but chooses dominant partners).
4. Trauma-to-Standard Conversion
   - Translate negative experiences into filtering criteria (e.g., betrayal → trust reconstruction standard).
5. Deep Listening Engine
   - Detect emotionally charged keywords like “safe,” “suffocating,” “seen,” etc.
6. Iceberg Questioning Framework
   - Surface → Deep: Behavior → Emotion → Belief
   - Example: “When you say you like stability, what emotion does that give you?”
7. Need Translation Skill
   - Turn vague preferences into concrete indicators (e.g., “ambitious” → career path clarity or skill-building habits).
8. Relational Dimension Library
   - Instantly relate responses to six key dimensions: communication style / money views / sexual expectations / family roles / boundaries / crisis coping
